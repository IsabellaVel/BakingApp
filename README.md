# BakingApp
The BakingApp is part of the Android developer Nanodegree of Udacity and Google.

It shows several recipes for baking a cake. The recipes have video content.
The widget shows the ingredients of the last viewed recipe.

I have prepared the app with master-detail flow, Exoplayer, also prepared tests with the Espresso library.
